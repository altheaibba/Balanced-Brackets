# Balanced-Brackets
This is a second-year assignment for an Algorithms & Data Structures module. It implements a Stack to denote whether or not all the brackets in a String are balanced. They are considered balanced if:
- For every opening bracket, there is a closing bracket of the same type. 
- An opening must appear before its matching closing bracket. 
- No unmatched brackets lie between some pair of matched ones,e.g. {[()]} is balanced but {[}] is NOT balanced.
